### SNES lua scripts to add mainly mouse support for Lemmings 1+2, SimCity and Dungeon Master 

For LUA support, I recommend [gotchas snes-rr](https://github.com/gocha/snes9x-rr/releases/download/1.60/snes9x-rr-1.60-win32.zip "gotchas snes-rr"). I have no clue if the scripts are compatible with other emulators, and imho it's a pity that official snes9x has no support for lua. And as far as I know, no snes9x linux lua port at all.

have fun...
